
Classes:
- Every java application must have at least one class, and at least one main method (but not one main per class, jur one main per application).
- A class has instance variables and methods.
- A class is used to contruct objects.
-  Java does manipulate objects by reference, and all object variables are references. However, Java doesn't pass method arguments by reference; it passes them by value.
- So object variables are references.
- Primitive vs reference:
    * Primitive variables are of type -> byte, int, float, double, string, etc.
    * Reference variables are of type -> Dog, MyClass, Class2, etc.
        - it basically references the class type you created.
