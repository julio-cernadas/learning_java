

- Java Software Development is split into microservices
    * these should be "small focused" and "autonomous" units.
    * the point is to keep them seperate, they will communicate through network calls.
    * the goal is to be able to change and deploy our application w/out impacting other services!

- Commonly used structure for projets:
    * src - contains all your source files, and possibly the following as well (might be far down the folder tree):
        - resources - contains resources such as properties files
        - config - everything config related
    * lib - a folder containing a your libraries, possibly placed in separate subfolders
    * bin - contains compiled classes

- When desigining the flow of an application, use draw.io like style:
    * circles - means starting point and ending point
    * rectangles - are used to represent an action or method
    * diamonds - are used to represent a decision point.
